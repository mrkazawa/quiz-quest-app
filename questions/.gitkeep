# Quiz Questions Folder

This folder stores quiz JSON files created through the teacher interface.

The application will automatically create quiz files here when teachers:
1. Create new quizzes through the "Create Quiz" feature
2. Import quiz JSON files

Files are named with the pattern: `{quizId}.json`

## Example Quiz File Structure:
```json
{
  "setName": "General Knowledge",
  "setDescription": "A quiz about general knowledge",
  "roomId": "quiz123",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "options": ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "timeLimit": 30,
      "points": 100
    }
  ]
}
```
